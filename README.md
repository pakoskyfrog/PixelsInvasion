#              README : Pixels Invasion
===========================================================

## 1/ What is the PI project ?

It's a small remake of the big old classic Invaders.
The enemies will be shaped randomly by an 'adjacent pixels' method.
At first the firing system will be very simple : bullets, lasers, some bombs.

## 2/ Project plan

Here is the list of steps I will follow :

    - Create the file architecture
    - Build a state application framework
    - Make a main menu with credits, difficulty/size choice, music/sounds options ...
    - Make the shape generators
    - Make a stary background
    - Add user interactions with the main ship
    - Enemis movements
    - Projectils
    - Event-driven collision system
    - Winning / loosing the game
    - Make a background music and sound effects
    

## 3/ Advancements

    - Architecture : 75%
    - Apps/game states
    - LR shape gen
    - Basic entities, Foe Shield Ship Squadron
    - Basic HUD
    - Choosing ship menu
    - Starfield game background
    - Better placement on squadron generation
    - Wall/neighbor foe collision
